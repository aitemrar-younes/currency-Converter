# currency-converter
I highly recommend beginners to react native or other framework to make similar app, it seems easy for intermediate or advanced level, but for the beginner is the best way to learn a bunch of things. 
I have developed this application using react native
To accomplish  this, I used an API from "freecurrencyapi.net"
What I have learned during this project:
    1.fetch API and grab data
    2.formating data to make it easy for accessing it
    3.create my own select component
    4.how to use modals
    5.how to use some hooks
    6.work with "list data structure"
    7.styling the interface
